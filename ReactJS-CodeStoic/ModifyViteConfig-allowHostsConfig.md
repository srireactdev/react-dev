It looks like you're encountering a Vite security restriction when trying to access your development server. Here's how to fix it:

### Solution:
1. Open your `vite.config.js` file
2. Add the Gitpod host to the `server.allowedHosts` configuration

### Example configuration:
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    allowedHosts: [
      '5173-srireactdev-reactdev-lxd8iup6e2l.ws-us118.gitpod.io'
    ]
  },
  // ... other configurations
})
```

### Alternative (allow all hosts - less secure):
If you want to allow all hosts (not recommended for production):
```javascript
server: {
  allowedHosts: 'all'
}
```

### Note:
- The hostname changes each time you restart your Gitpod workspace, so you might need to update this configuration frequently
- For Gitpod specifically, you might want to use a pattern that matches all Gitpod hosts:
  ```javascript
  server: {
    allowedHosts: ['.gitpod.io', '.ws-us118.gitpod.io']
  }
  ```

After making these changes, restart your Vite dev server for the changes to take effect.
